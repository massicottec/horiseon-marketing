# Accessibility code refactoring

    The refactoring of the existing code was to have the website meet accessibility standards better.

## Motivation

    This was needed to make the website easier to access for users and find via engine searches.

## Usage

    <img src="./assets/images/horiseon-readme" alt="webpage mock-up"/>
