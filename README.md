# Accessibility code refactoring

    The refactoring of the existing code was to have the website meet accessibility standards better.  Indoing so, the HTML elements were changed to sementic elements and the CSS was condensed done for easier read ability.

## Motivation

    This was needed to make the website easier to access for users and find via search engines.  Also was a good practice to get more use to webpage structure and coding.
